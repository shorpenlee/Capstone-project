## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
setwd("~/Capstone-project")
getwd()
data(cars)
list.files()
sampleDataFileName <- "data/final/en_US/en_US.sample.txt"
con <- file(sampleDataFileName, open = "w")
writeLines(as.character(cars), con)
```
